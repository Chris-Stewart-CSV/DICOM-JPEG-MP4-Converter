# Medical Image (.dcm) file converting scripts (to .jpg or .mp4)

## Motivation for Project
<p align="left">
Often times medical imaging is provided to the patient in the form of a downloadable .iso file and requires either special software or some other inconveinent means to view the images/videos at home.
This will let you take the files from the .iso files and make them more accessible to viewing at home. Enjoy!

## Minimum Requirements
<p align="left">
Scripts were written using Python 3.12.0 and require no additional installations (pip install xx not needed)

** Note to run script open command prompt and type "python DCM_to_JPG_ConverterScript.py"
** Make sure to add the file paths to your .dcm files and the output folder where you want the converted images/videos to go
   DICOM_DIR = "directory/to/your/dcm/files/here" # Folder with .dcm files
   OUTPUT_DIR = "directory/to/your/desired/output/folder/here" # Where to save JPEGs
