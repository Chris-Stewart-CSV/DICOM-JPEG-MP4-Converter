# Medical Image File (.dcm) conversion to (.jpg & .mp4)

## Motivation for Project
<p align="left">
Often times medical imaging when provided to the patient to take home are on a disc or in a downloadable file (often times an .iso). For ultrasounds, MRI's, etc. this is the standard.
These scripts will let you take the DICOM (.dcm) files off the disc (or extracted from the (.iso) file and convert them to a more friendly format (.jpg / .mp4).
Originally intended this script for personal use, but figured others may benefit. Enjoy!


## To run script
------------------------
Open command prompt, navigate to where the script is located and type:

### "python DCM_to_JPG_Converter_Script.py"
OR
### "python DCM_to_MP4_Converter_Script.py"


### File paths
------------------------
Update file paths for input files and output files:

### DICOM_DIR = "directory/to/your/dcm/files/here" # Folder with .dcm files
### OUTPUT_DIR = "directory/to/your/desired/output/folder/here" # Where to save JPEGs


### Minimum Requirements
------------------------
Scripts were written using Python 3.12.0 and require no additional installations (pip install xx not needed)
